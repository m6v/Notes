====== Setting Up a Raspberry Pi From Scratch ======
Создан Четверг 16 Январь 2020

The SD card on one of my Raspberry Pi systems filled up recently, so I decided to wipe it and reinstall Raspbian. The main Rasbian distribution, however, is designed to help teach kids to code and includes lots of tools that I generally don’t use, so I decided to build it from scratch.

The Raspberry Pi Foundation provides a light version of the Raspbian OS, which is intended for Pis used as servers or in embedded devices. Raspbian Jessie Lite doesn’t include a graphical interface by default, nor does it include any of the various browsers, office tools, or programming tools that you’d normally expect to see on a Pi. It’s pretty much just the basic OS and the standard utilities you’ll to find on any Linux machine.

To get started, download the latest Raspbian Jessie Lite image and use your method of choice to install it on your SD card. Since I’m working form a Mac, I usually use IvanX’s Pi Filler. Once the card is built, stick it in your Pi, boot up, and run raspi-config right away to set up your Pi and change your password.

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
sudo raspi-config
}}}

Since this is an advanced tutorial, I’ll assume you’re already familiar with raspi-config, so I won’t spend time on it here. If you need help, there are plenty of tutorials online.

Now, I’ve never been a fan of the Raspberry Pi’s desktop environment, LXDE. I just don’t really like how it looks and it’s difficult to customize. PIXEL, the new implementation of LXDE on new versions of Raspbian is a little better looking, but I still can’t get into it. Instead, I much prefer XFCE, another lightweight desktop environment. Unlike LXDE, you can configure XFCE up the ying-yang, making things look exactly the way you want.

We first need to install the XWindow system, which is the low-level software that allows graphical desktops. Since we don’t want to accidentally install any of the default PIXEL libraries, however, we’ll use the -—no-install-recommends option with apt-get:

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
sudo apt-get install -—no-install-recommends xserver-xorg
sudo apt-get install -—no-install-recommends xinit
}}}

Next we’ll install XFCE, the XFCE terminal application, and the LightDM display manager:

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
sudo apt-get install xfce4 xfce4-terminal lightdm
}}}

This will install a ton of dependencies, and will take a while to complete.

At this point you could run startx and have a working system, but it would be extremely basic, so we’ll also add a bunch of XFCE utilities. These let you add desktop features like status bar icons and desktop widgets that help make the interface more user friendly:

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
sudo apt-get install xfce4-goodies xfce4-indicator-plugin xfce4-limelight-plugin xfce4-mpc-plugin xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin
}}}

Now lets start the graphical environment:

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
startx
}}}

The first time you run XFCE, you’ll see a screen that looks something like this:
