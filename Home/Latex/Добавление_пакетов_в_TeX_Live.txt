====== Добавление пакетов в TeX Live ======
Создан Четверг 26 Декабрь 2019

Before using tlmgr in user mode, you have to set up the user tree with the init-usertree action. This creates $HOME/texmf/web2c and $HOME/texmf/tlpkg/tlpobj, and a minimal usertree/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb. At that point, you can tell tlmgr to do the (supported) actions by adding the --usermode command line option.

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
$ sudo apt-get install xzdec
$ tlmgr --version
}}}

WARNING: tlmgr in Debian runs always in user mode

Initializing the user tree
The first thing to be done is initializing the user tree. By default, the user tree that is to be handled will be TEXMFHOME, which amounts to ~/texmf. If you want to change that, all the following commands also take an additional option --usertree to specify the tree.
tlmgr init-usertree
which sets up the initial empty TeX Live database and creates necessary files. In case there is already a file in TEXMFHOME/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb the command will bail out. Other directories generated are TEXMFHOME/web2c and TEXMFHOME/tlpkg/tlpobj.

The first thing to call is

===== Adding a new package to a latex install on linux =====
If you want to install a custom TeX package that is not already in Debian's repositories, take a look at CTAN's web site or TeX Catalogue Online.

Download the package and extract it with tar -xvf foo.tar.gz.

Enter the directory, if you see foo.ins, run it trough LaTeX

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
$ latex foo.ins
}}}


This generates foo.sty. Now you have to copy it to the system LaTeX tree or your personal tree. After installation, you can use the new package by inserting \usepackage{foo} in the beginning of the document.

==== User install ====
This method creates a personal texmf tree to your home folder. The files are installed only to the original user.

Create the directory structure:

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
$ mkdir -p ~/texmf/tex/latex/foo
}}}


It's a good idea to create separate subdirectories in latex for different custom packages. Copy the newly generated foo.tex to your tree. After this, update the LaTeX package cache with

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
$ texhash ~/texmf
}}}


==== System install ====
This method installs the package in the LaTeX system tree. The new package is available to all users.

Create a new directory as root

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
$ mkdir /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/foo
}}}


Copy the new LaTeX package foo.tex to the new folder, and update the LaTeX package cache

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
$ texhash
}}}
